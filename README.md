# Gender Prediction Using Machine Learning in Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Gender Prediction Model using Machine Learning techniques. The model predicts gender based on the last letter of a given name. It uses Logistic Regression for classification and evaluates its performance using Accuracy and F1-score. Additionally, an interactive user interface allows users to input names and receive real-time gender predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset
- **Feature Extraction**: Using the last letter of a name as a key feature
- **Machine Learning Model**: Logistic Regression for classification
- **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy, F1-score, and visualization using Confusion Matrix
- **User Interaction**: Enter a name, and the model predicts its gender
- **Visualization**: Graphs for model performance insights

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**:
🔗 [Name-Gender Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00591/name_gender_dataset.csv)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **CountVectorizer** (Feature Extraction)
- **Logistic Regression** (Model Training)
- **StandardScaler** (Feature Scaling)

## 📌 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Gender-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Gender-Prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python gender_prediction.py
   ```

## 🏆 Model Performance
- **Accuracy Score**: Achieved high accuracy in predicting gender
- **F1-Score**: Effective in balancing precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes correct and incorrect predictions

## 🎯 How to Use
1. Run the script
2. Enter a name when prompted
3. Get the predicted gender instantly
4. Type **'exit'** to stop the program

## 📊 Results & Future Enhancements
✅ The model effectively predicts gender using text-based features.
✅ Future improvements may include **full-name analysis** and **deep learning models** for better accuracy.
✅ Stay tuned for the upcoming **Power BI project** exploring data visualization and business intelligence.
